## The "no control group" setting

::: {.incremental}
- **Problem:** In many real-world scenarios, finding a credible control group to evaluate a policy is not feasible.
- **Example:** Health care policies often affect all providers simultaneously, like changes in physician compensation or changes in guidelines.

- **Solution:** interrupted time series (ITS)

- **Challenge:**  Standard interrupted time series (ITS) may produce biased estimates because of poor prediction, poor forecasting, and simplification assumptions with panel data.

No staggered intervention, no control group, no Diff-in-Diff
No untreated units: forecast the counterfactual.

**"The risk of bias for ITS studies was high for 53.3% and very high for 19.2%". (@hategeka2020use, N = 120, 1990-2020)**

- The intervention was dependent of other changes.
- Time series techniques were not propertly used.
- Trends and time-dependent covariates were not correctly specified.

## With "`itsCausal`", we aim to deliver a set of recommendations for practitioners

- **Key Idea: create an R-package "`itsCausal`", which**
  - Provides guidance on the application of Interrupted Time Series
  - Enhances the traditional model with a machine learning-based method to address the "no control group" scenario and improve counterfactual forecasting.
  - Tailors the method to panel data where the number of units exceeds the number of time periods.

::: {.notes}
Widely used in real-world evidence, public health, health services research, health economics, and epidemiology.

Problem: its targets one average effect
No untreated units: forecast the counterfactual.

- **How it works:**
  - Use machine learners and ensemble methods to train models on pre-intervention data.
  - Forecast onto the post-intervention period ("counterfactual").
  - Compare actual outcomes with predicted counterfactuals to estimate causal effects.
  - Aggregate results for the desired population and the desired time period.

- **ML learners** (random forest, gradient boosting, neural networks, catboost, lstm) with hyperparameters tuning.
- **Rolling-window approach** for post-intervention forecasts with time-variant and invariant predictors.
- Effect computed as the difference between the observed and the forecasted values.
- **Simulations** of different data-generating processes show good performance.

# Appendix

# Identifying assumptions for the causal effect in its

The following assumptions must hold (see @cerqua2024nocontrol):

  1. There are no hidden forms of treatment leading to different potential outcomes (**weak SUTVA**).
  2. **Additivity**
  3. **No anticipation and no confounding**
    - Absence of anticipatory effects of the intervention on the covariates and the potential outcomes
    - Future covariates do not affect current potential outcomes
    - Covariates remain unaffected by the policy in the post-intervention period (post-treatment exogeneity of the covariates)
  4. **Dynamic potential outcomes model**: the potential outcomes absent the policy (the "counterfactual") can be predicted using lagged values of the outcome and of the covariates.
  5. **Post-intervention non-linear multi-step-ahead model**: the counterfactual can be predicted for multiple periods ahead using lagged values of the outcomes until the intervention, conditional expectations of the outcome after the intervention, and the covariates.

<!--  the potential outcome absent the policy is a flexible function of the past lags of the outcome, the contemporaneous covariates, and the past lags of covariates. The error term is a zero-mean, uncorrelated error term following a generic distribution.
